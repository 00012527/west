i created this chart to show my univeristy's Mitigating Circumstance throught the year.
These codes are not so complicated, by writing codes to illustrate my university's process, i have learned how to work on python quite good.
Knowing my mitigating circumstance on my own computer with the help of codes that i have written motivated me to make this beatiful program.
